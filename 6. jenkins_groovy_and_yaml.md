Groovy Script:
Groovy Script is a java based object oriented programming and scripting language which runs on Java Virtual Machine. Groovy has very similar syntax with Java language.

Mandatory Parts:
Agent: Slave on which jenkins pipeline is executed.
Stages: Block that includes multiple stage in a pipeline.
Stage: A stage is a block in which tasks are performed through a jenkins pipeline.
Steps: All the tasks performed in any stage.

Example Pipeline
```
library 'libraryname'

pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        APP_NAME= ""
        BRANCH_NAME = ""
        EAI_NUMBER = ""
        SONAR_NAME= ""
      }
    tools{
            gradle "Gradle_4.0.2"
              //mavan "Maven 3.3.9"
          jdk 'JAVA_8'
        }
  stages{
    stage('Build') {
			    steps{
				script{withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'xxxxx', passwordVariable: 'NEXUS_PASSWORD', usernameVariable: 'NEXUS_USER')]) {
                        sh "mvn -s clean build"
                        sh "ls -al ${WORKSPACE}/target"
                    }
                }
          }
    }
    stage('sonarqube'){
                steps{
                  #paths and sonarqube details
                }
    }
    stage('Deployment'){
                steps{
                  #deployment steps
                }
    }
  }
}
```
```
Parallel staging:

pipeline {
    agent any

stages {
        stage('Parallel Stages') {
            parallel {
                stage('Stage 1') {
                    steps {
                        echo "Running Stage 1"
                        sleep 10
                    }
                }
                stage('Stage 2') {
                    steps {
                        echo "Running Stage 2"
                        sleep 10
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
YAML:
YAML means yet another markup language. It is a data serialization language that works well with the modern programming language, and it is human-friendly.
It is used to define the data structures that are very easy to understand. These data structures are very easy to manage and maintain by the users.
YAML uses space to define something. If we use a single space or double space, it has different meanings in YAML. Spaces change the meaning of data structure.
YAML is case sensitive.
