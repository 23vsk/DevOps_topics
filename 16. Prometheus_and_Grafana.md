## What is Prometheus?
>Prometheus is an open-source system monitoring and alerting toolkit. It's mainly used for collecting metrics from configured targets at given intervals, storing them efficiently, and allowing powerful queries (via its query language called PromQL).

>*In short*: Prometheus helps you monitor applications, servers, databases, etc., and alert you if something is wrong.
>Example use cases:
> - Monitoring server CPU, memory, and disk usage.
> - Watching Kubernetes cluster health.
> - Alerting when a web service is too slow.

### Prometheus Architecture
>Here’s the basic architecture:
#### Prometheus Server:
>Core component.
>It scrapes (pulls) metrics data from applications (targets) via HTTP endpoints (usually /metrics endpoint).
>Stores all the data in its time-series database.
#### Targets:
>These are your applications or services that expose metrics (example: a Node Exporter for system metrics, or a custom app exposing /metrics).
#### Service Discovery:
>Helps Prometheus find the targets automatically (works well with dynamic environments like Kubernetes, EC2, etc.).
#### Data Storage:
>Prometheus stores metrics locally on disk in a time-series database.
>You can also set up remote storage integrations for longer-term storage.
#### PromQL:
>A powerful query language for selecting and aggregating time series data.
#### Alertmanager:
>A separate component.
>Receives alerts from Prometheus, then manages them (like grouping, silencing) and sends notifications via email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.
#### Visualization (Optional):
>Prometheus has a basic built-in dashboard, but people often use Grafana to create beautiful visual dashboards with Prometheus data.

### Simple Diagram View:
```
[Targets (Apps/Servers)] --> [Prometheus Server (scrape & store)] --> [Alertmanager (alerts)]  
                                                           ↓
                                                      [Grafana (dashboards)]
```

### What is Grafana?
>Grafana is an open-source analytics and visualization platform. It's mainly used for monitoring, observing, and analyzing metrics from various data sources. Think of it as a dashboard builder where you can create beautiful, real-time visualizations — like graphs, charts, alerts — based on your data.
>It was originally built for time-series data (data over time, like CPU usage, server uptime, etc.), but now it's flexible enough for logs, events, and even non-time-series databases.

>3662 is a standard template used in grafana.

### Key Features of Grafana
>- Custom Dashboards: Build interactive, dynamic dashboards with graphs, tables, heatmaps, and more.
>- Multiple Data Sources: Connects to tons of sources like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, Graphite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Loki, and many others.
>- Alerting: Set up threshold-based alerts that notify you via Slack, email, PagerDuty, and more.
>- User Management: Manage user roles, teams, and permissions.
>- Templating: Create dynamic dashboards with drop-downs and variables — super useful for reusable setups.
>- Plugins: Extend Grafana with community or custom plugins for panels, data sources, and apps.
>- Annotations: Mark graphs with events (like deployments) to see correlations.
>- Cloud-native: Can be self-hosted or used via Grafana Cloud for a managed experience.
>- Reporting: Generate PDF reports from dashboards and schedule their delivery.
>- Cross-platform: Runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, Docker.

### Step by step process to configure monitoring for kubernetes using Prometeus and Grafana

>Prometheus collects metrics from Kubernetes by scraping HTTP endpoints where metrics are exposed (usually /metrics path).

#### Step 1. Prerequisites
>A running Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, EKS, AKS, GKE, or your own setup).
>kubectl configured to connect to your cluster.
>helm installed (package manager for Kubernetes).

#### Step2. Install Prometheus and Grafana using Helm
>Instead of manually creating deployments and services, the easiest way is to use the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart.
>Add Helm repos
```
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

helm repo update
```
#### Step3. Install kube-prometheus-stack
>This stack installs:
>- Prometheus
>- Grafana
>- Alertmanager
>- Node Exporter
>- Kube-State-Metrics
>- ServiceMonitors, and more.
```
helm install monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
```
>or you can specify a namespace:
```
kubectl create namespace monitoring

helm install monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring
```
#### Step4. Access Prometheus and Grafana UI
>Since both Prometheus and Grafana services are ClusterIP by default, you’ll need port-forwarding:
```
kubectl port-forward svc/monitoring-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus 9090:9090 --namespace monitoring
```
>Port-forward Grafana
```
kubectl port-forward svc/monitoring-grafana 3000:80 --namespace monitoring
```
#### Step5. Login to Grafana
>Default Username: admin
>Default Password: prom-operator
>You can get the real password like this if it’s generated randomly
```
kubectl get secret --namespace monitoring monitoring-grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo
```
#### Step6. Explore Dashboards
>Grafana already includes pre-built Kubernetes dashboards. Once you log in:
>Go to Dashboards ➔ Manage ➔ you’ll see Kubernetes-related dashboards like:
>- Cluster Monitoring
>- Node Monitoring
>- Pod Monitoring
#### Step7. (Optional) Customize Monitoring
>If you want to monitor your own apps:
>- Add ServiceMonitor or PodMonitor CRDs to monitor custom metrics exposed by your apps.
>- Example: Your app exposes /metrics endpoint — you can tell Prometheus to scrape it.
#### Step8. (Optional) Expose Services Publicly
>If you want Prometheus and Grafana accessible externally without port-forward:
>Use an Ingress (e.g., Nginx, Traefik).
>Change service type to LoadBalancer. Example to patch Grafana:
```
kubectl patch svc monitoring-grafana -n monitoring -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

## How do you configure Grafana dashboards to monitor docker containers?
> Monitoring Docker containers with Grafana usually involves collecting metrics using Prometheus (or another data source), and then visualizing them in Grafana. Here's a full step-by-step breakdown to help you configure Grafana dashboards for Docker monitoring:
#### Architecture Overview
```
[ Docker Containers ]
        ↓
[ cAdvisor / node-exporter ] → [ Prometheus ]
                                      ↓
                               [ Grafana Dashboards ]
```
> - Step 1: Set Up Prometheus
> - Step 2: Add cAdvisor and Node Exporter
> - Step 3: Set Up Grafana
> - Step 4: Import Docker Monitoring Dashboards
##### You’ll See Metrics Like:
> - Container CPU/memory usage
> - Disk I/O
> - Network traffic
> - Uptime
> - Docker container count
> - Host system performance

## Can we also do alerting using Grafana without prometeus.
> - Yes, Grafana can do alerting on its own, even without Prometheus as a data source! You just need some kind of data source that provides time-series metrics for Grafana to query.
> - While Prometheus is commonly used because of its powerful querying capabilities and integration with Grafana, other data sources like InfluxDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or even Elasticsearch can also be used for Grafana alerting.

## Why do we use prometeus and Grafana? What does Grafana do and what does prometeus do?
> - Prometheus is used to collect, store, and query time-series metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk usage, etc.) from various sources (like containers, nodes, or applications).
> - Grafana is used to visualize these metrics from Prometheus (or other data sources) into interactive and customizable dashboards for easy analysis and monitoring.
