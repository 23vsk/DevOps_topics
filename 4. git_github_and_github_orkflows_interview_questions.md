## How to create or initialize the git respository
>git init and creates .git folder

## Command to check untracked files
```
git status
```
## Command to push the code to local repo
``` 
git add
```
## The difference between git fetch, git pull, and git push lies in how they interact with the remote repository.
### git fetch (Get Latest Changes Without Merging)
>   Retrieves new changes from the remote repository but does not merge them into your local branch.
>   Allows you to check updates before applying them.
>   Useful for checking what has changed before merging.
>
>   This fetches the latest changes from the origin remote but doesn’t modify your working directory.
```
git fetch origin
```

### git pull (Fetch + Merge)
>   Fetches new changes from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch.
>   Equivalent to running git fetch followed by git merge.
>   Used to update your local branch with remote changes.
>
>   This fetches the latest changes from the main branch and merges them into your local branch.
```
git pull origin main
```

### git push (Upload Local Changes to Remote)
>   Sends your local commits to the remote repository.
>   Only works if your local branch is ahead of the remote branch (i.e., you have new commits).
>   If someone else has pushed changes that you don’t have, you may need to git pull first.
>
>   This pushes your local main branch to the remote repository.

## Advantages of GitHub Actions over Jenkins
> Hosting: Jenkins is self-hosted, meaning it requires its own server to run, while GitHub Actions is hosted by GitHub and runs directly in your GitHub repository.
> User interface: Jenkins has a complex and sophisticated user interface, while GitHub Actions has a more streamlined and user-friendly interface that is better suited for simple to moderate automation tasks.
>Cost: Jenkins can be expensive to run and maintain, especially for organizations with large and complex automation needs. GitHub Actions, on the other hand, is free for open-source projects and has a tiered pricing model for private repositories, making it more accessible to smaller organizations and individual developers.
