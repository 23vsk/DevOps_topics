### Maven Life Cycle or What are Maven Phases and Goals.
```
Default Maven Lifecycle 

The default Maven lifecycle is the main lifecycle used to build and deploy your project. It includes phases related to compiling, testing, packaging, and deploying your project.
Key Phases in the Default Lifecycle:
validate: Validates the project setup to ensure all necessary information is available (e.g., POM file, dependencies).
compile: Compiles the source code of the project.
test: Runs unit tests using a testing framework (such as JUnit). It is done after compiling the code but before packaging.
package: Packages the compiled code into its distributable format, such as a JAR, WAR, or EAR file.
verify: Runs any checks to verify the package is valid and meets all quality standards.
install: Installs the packaged artifact (e.g., JAR, WAR) into your local Maven repository (~/.m2/repository), making it available for use in other projects.
deploy: Deploys the artifact to a remote repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory), making it available to other developers or projects.

validate -> compile -> test -> package -> verify -> install -> deploy
```

### Maven Commaands:
```
Clean and Build: mvn clean install
clean: Deletes the target directory (previous build files).
install: Compiles, runs tests and packages the application into the local repository.

Skip Tests: mvn clean install -DskipTests
DskipTests: Skips running unit tests.

Package Without Tests: mvn clean package -DskipTests
package: Packages the application without installing it in the local repository.
```

### Gradle Commands:
```
Clean and Build: ./gradlew clean build
clean: Removes the build directory (previous build files).
build: Assembles and tests the project.

Skip Tests: ./gradlew build -x test
Skips running unit tests.

Assemble (Without Tests): ./gradlew assemble
Builds the project but skips testing.
```

### Apache Server (HTTP Server)
>Apache HTTP Server is an open-source, high-performance web server developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It primarily serves static and dynamic content over the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

### Apache Tomcat Server
>Apache Tomcat is an open-source application server developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is designed to deploy and run Java-based web applications.

### How maven will know to build the application?
>Maven knows how to build an application by using the pom.xml (Project Object Model) file, which contains all the configuration and instructions needed to compile, test, and package the project. The pom.xml file serves as the blueprint for Maven to understand the structure, dependencies, build phases, and other configurations of your project.
>
>Maven knows how to build an application by reading and interpreting the pom.xml file. This file contains all the necessary information, such as:
>   Project structure
>   Dependencies
>   Plugins
>   Build phases
>By following the instructions in the pom.xml, Maven automates the tasks of compiling, testing, packaging, and deploying your project.
