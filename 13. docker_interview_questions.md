## What is Docker?
> Docker is open source containerisation platform which is used to manage life cycle of containers. 
> I have build containers, write the docker file and push into the registry.

## How container are virtual machines?
> Containers very light weight in nature they doesn't have complete operating system. But they have very minimal system dependencies that are required to run the application.
>Virtual machine if we create EC2 instance it has complete operating system.

## What is Docker Life cycle?
> Firstly we will write a Docker file and write set of instructions --> Build the docker file and it will create a docker image --> Push into the docker registry

## What are the different Docker Components?
> - **Client** --> Docker CLI user can run the docker command like docker pull, docker run, docker build
> - **Docker Host** --> Docker Demon is a heart of docker if it is goes down nothing will work in docker It will execute the commands which are given by the user and creates images and containers.
> - **Registry** --> we can push and pull images from the registry

## What are docker file commands?
> Dockerfile is a text file that contains a series of instructions or commands used to build a Docker image. Each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a layer in the image, and the image is built from these instructions.
#### Command
```
FROM - Set base image
LABEL - Add metadata (e.g., maintainer, version)
RUN - Execute commands during the build process
COPY - Copy files or directories into the image
ADD - Copy files or directories (with extra features like URL support)
CMD - Set the default command to run when the container starts
ENTRYPOINT - Set the main command to run when the container starts
ENV - Set environment variables
EXPOSE - Expose network ports
VOLUME - Create mount points for volumes
USER - Set the user to run subsequent commands
WORKDIR - Set the working directory
ARG - Define build-time variables
STOPSIGNAL - Set the stop signal
HEALTHCHECK - Set the health check for the container
SHELL - Set the default shell for running commands
```

## Difference between ADD and COPY Command in Docker
> The main difference between COPY and ADD in Docker is that COPY is a straightforward command used to copy files and directories from the build context (your local machine) into the container, whereas ADD provides additional functionality such as allowing remote URL downloads and automatically extracting compressed archives (e.g., .tar.gz).

# When to Use COPY?
>COPY should be used when you just need to transfer files from the host system to the container without any extra processing. It is more predictable and avoids unintended behaviors like automatic extraction.
```
COPY myfile.txt /app/
```

# When to Use ADD?
>ADD is useful when you need extra features like downloading files from a remote URL and automatic extraction of .tar files.
```
ADD archive.tar.gz /app/
```

## Realtime challenges with Docker?
> 1. Docker has a single point of failure. If docker daemon goes down, application is down. 
> 2. Docker run as root user which is a security threat.
> 3. Resource constraints - if you are running too many containers on a single host, you may experience resource constraints. This can lead to slow performance or crashes.
> Solution is Podman. Which solves your docker problem. It is not single point failure, it can run as normal non-root user.

## What steps you will take to secure containers?
> 1. Use distroless or image with not too many packages as your final image in multi stage build.
> 2. Ensure that networking is configured properly. If required configure custom bridge network and assign them to isolate networks. Create different bridge network for finance application.
> 3. Use utilities like Sync to scan your container images. Before you push them to production or staging environment.

## What is the difference between CMD and entrypoint in docker?
> The CMD instruction specifies default arguments or commands that can be overridden when the container is started.
```
CMD command param1 param2
```
> The ENTRYPOINT instruction defines the fixed executable that will always run when the container starts.
```
ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2
```

## Give me the steps for scenerio we had artifact repo like nexus we need to pull image from it using docker commands.
> Jenkinsfile to Pull Image from Nexus Docker Registry
```
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        DOCKER_IMAGE = 'nexus.example.com:8083/my-app:1.0.0'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Pull Image from Nexus') {
            steps {
                script {
                    withCredentials([usernamePassword(
                        credentialsId: 'nexus-docker-creds',
                        usernameVariable: 'NEXUS_USER',
                        passwordVariable: 'NEXUS_PASS'
                    )]) {
                        sh """
                            echo "$NEXUS_PASS" | docker login nexus.example.com:8083 -u "$NEXUS_USER" --password-stdin
                            docker pull ${DOCKER_IMAGE}
                            docker logout nexus.example.com:8083
                        """
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
> Here are the raw Docker commands to pull an image from a Nexus Docker registry:
```
# Login to Nexus Docker registry
docker login nexus.example.com:8083 -u <username> -p <password>

# Pull the Docker image
docker pull nexus.example.com:8083/my-app:1.0.0

# (Optional) Run the container
docker run -d --name my-app-container nexus.example.com:8083/my-app:1.0.0

# Logout from registry (optional but recommended)
docker logout nexus.example.com:8083
```

## What is a muLti stage build in docker? OR Do you know docker multi layer image or multi stage image. Why we use?
> Multi stage build allows you to build the docker container in multiple stages allowing you to copy artifacts from one stage to other. Major advantage is to build the light weight applications.

```
#dockerfile
# Step 1: Build the Go binary
FROM golang:1.18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod tidy
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp .

# Step 2: Create the final image with the compiled binary
FROM gcr.io/distroless/base
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp
CMD ["/myapp"]
```

## Docker image is of 1GB and you want to reduce to 10O or 200KB. What is the apporach?
> - Start with a minimal base image (e.g., Alpine).
> - Use multi-stage builds to separate the build and runtime environments.
> - Clean up unnecessary files by using .dockerignore.
> - Combine Dockerfile commands to minimize layers.
> - Optimize your application size (minify, compress, or prune dependencies).
> - Squash layers to merge them into a smaller final image.
> - Consider compressing binaries if your app uses compiled code.

## In Muilti stage Docker file, what are the overwrites you will remove later stage?
> - Build tools and compilers (e.g., gcc, make, npm).
> - Development dependencies (e.g., devDependencies in package.json).
> - Temporary files and caches (e.g., npm cache, build artifacts).
> - Test files, logs, and documentation.
> - Source code (if only runtime is needed, e.g., after compiling or bundling).

## How we can achieve docker image optimization?
##### 1. Use a Smaller Base Image
> Start with a lightweight base image like:
> - alpine (≈5 MB)
> - debian:slim
> - scratch (for advanced use, no OS at all)
```
FROM node:alpine
```
##### 2. Multi-stage Builds
> Build your app in one stage, and copy only the necessary artifacts (e.g., binary, static files) to the final image.
```
# Stage 1: Build
FROM golang:alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o main .

# Stage 2: Final image
FROM alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/main /app/
CMD ["/app/main"]
```
##### 3. Minimize Layers
> Each RUN, COPY, or ADD instruction adds a new layer. Combine related commands into one.
```
# Less optimal
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl

# Better
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```
##### 4. Clean Up After Installing
> If you're using a package manager (like apt, yum, apk, npm, etc.), clear the cache and remove temp files after installing.
```
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y python3 && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```
##### 5. Use .dockerignore File
> Exclude files and directories that are not needed in the image, like:
```
node_modules
.git
*.log
tests/
README.md
```
##### 6. Use Specific Versions
> Avoid latest tag — always pin specific versions of base images and packages.
```
FROM python:3.11-slim
```
##### 7. Use Minimal Runtime Images
> In multi-stage builds, copy your app into distroless or scratch images:
```
FROM scratch
COPY mybinary /
CMD ["/mybinary"]
```
##### 8. Group COPY Statements
> Group and structure COPY instructions logically to avoid unnecessary rebuilds when a file changes.
```
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
```
### Example: Optimized Node.js Dockerfile
```
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:18-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Runtime
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build /app/package*.json ./
RUN npm install --only=production
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

## By using Dockerfile can we run multiple builds or jobs and is it helps in docker image optimization
> - Yes, a Dockerfile can run multiple builds or jobs using multi-stage builds, and 
> - Yes — this is a best practice for image optimization. You get smaller, faster, and more secure images.

## Where do you copy docker images and MSI files in repository
> 1. Docker Images: Push to a Docker registry (artifact repo for images)
```
Type          |         Example                           |     Description
Docker Hub    | docker.io/yourname/app:tag                | Public or private registry
AWS ECR       | xxxxxxxx.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/app | Amazon Elastic Container Registry
Azure ACR     | myregistry.azurecr.io/app                 | Azure Container Registry
JFrog / Nexus | artifactory.company.com/docker/app        | Enterprise Docker image repository
```
> 2. MSI Files (Windows Installer): Artifact Repo (Artifactory, Nexus) or Blob Storage
```
Tool              | Use For
JFrog Artifactory | Centralized storage of binaries like .msi, .exe, .zip, etc.
Sonatype Nexus    | Popular for .msi/.zip/.jar/.rpm/.deb artifacts
Azure Artifacts   | Great for Windows-based deployments
AWS S3            | You can store MSI files in versioned S3 buckets
GitHub Releases   | If you want to store the MSI as part of a release
Blob Storage      | Azure/AWS/Google blob storage is also common
```

## What is difference between Node and Port. How do we differentiate
##### What is a Node?
> A node is any device (server, VM, container, etc.) that can run processes and communicate on a network.
> In Kubernetes, a node is a worker machine (can be virtual or physical) that runs pods.
> In general networking, a node is just a host on a network.
##### What is a Port?
> A port is like a numbered “door” on a node through which network services (like web servers or databases) listen and communicate.
> Each port is bound to a specific service.
```
Port 22  → SSH  
Port 80  → HTTP  
Port 443 → HTTPS  
Port 3306 → MySQL
```
### Summary
> - Node: A machine or host on the network (can run services).
> - Port: A communication channel on a node for a specific service.

## What are the networking types in docker and what is the default?
> Docker supports several built-in network drivers:
>
> **🌐 bridge (default)**
> - Default network for containers on a single host.
> - Each container gets an IP from the bridge subnet.
> - Containers can talk to each other using container name.
> - Great for simple setups on a single host.
>
> **🧭 host**
> - Shares the host’s network stack (no isolation).
> - No separate container IP.
> - Useful for performance or specific network needs (like binding to ports directly on the host).
> 
> **🕳 none**
> - Completely disables networking.
> - Used for highly isolated containers.
> - You’ll need to manage networking manually (if at all).
>
> **🔌 overlay**
> - Used for multi-host container communication (like in Docker Swarm).
> - Allows services in different Docker hosts to communicate securely.
> - Requires a key-value store or Docker Swarm.
>
> **🧱 macvlan**
> - Assigns a MAC address to a container, like a physical machine.
> - Appears on the physical network as if it’s a separate device.
> - Used when containers need to be directly accessed on the LAN.
>
> **⚙️ custom networks (user-defined)**
>You can create custom bridge or overlay networks with specific subnets, gateways, etc.
>Allows more control over DNS resolution between containers.
>
> The default networking is the Bridge networking - There is a virtual ethernet or V8 that is created using which it tries to access host and application inside the container.

## Can you explain how to isolate networking between your container?
> - We can use different networking types like Bridge networking, Docker zero. 
> - While creating a container you can define networking in the command 
```
docker create network securenetwork
docker run --network=securenetwork
```

## What are distro less images in docker?
> Distro less images will contain only application and its runtime dependencies with very minimal operating system libraries. They are small and light weight images. It will help to secure from vulnarbilities.

```
docker pull gcr.io/distroless/python3

#dockerfile
FROM gcr.io/distroless/java
COPY target/myapp.jar /myapp.jar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/myapp.jar"]
