## Difference between ADD and COPY Command in Docker
>The main difference between COPY and ADD in Docker is that COPY is a straightforward command used to copy files and directories from the build context (your local machine) into the container, whereas ADD provides additional functionality such as allowing remote URL downloads and automatically extracting compressed archives (e.g., .tar.gz).

# When to Use COPY?
>COPY should be used when you just need to transfer files from the host system to the container without any extra processing. It is more predictable and avoids unintended behaviors like automatic extraction.
```
COPY myfile.txt /app/
```

# When to Use ADD?
>ADD is useful when you need extra features like downloading files from a remote URL and automatic extraction of .tar files.
```
ADD archive.tar.gz /app/
```

## Realtime challenges with Docker?
> 1. Docker has a single point of failure. If docker daemon goes down, application is down. 
> 2. Docker run as root user which is a security threat.
> 3. Resource constraints - if you are running too many containers on a single host, you may experience resource constraints. This can lead to slow performance or crashes.
> Solution is Podman. Which solves your docker problem. It is not single point failure, it can run as normal non-root user.

## What steps you will take to secure containers?
> 1. Use distroless or image with not too many packages as your final image in multi stage build.
> 2. Ensure that networking is configured properly. If required configure custom bridge network and assign them to isolate networks. Create different bridge network for finance application.
> 3. Use utilities like Sync to scan your container images. Before you push them to production or staging environment.

## What is Docker?
> Docker is open source containerisation platform which is used to manage life cycle of containers. 
> I have build containers, write the docker file and push into the registry.

## How container are virtual machines?
> Containers very light weight in nature they doesn't have complete operating system. But they have very minimal system dependencies that are required to run the application.
>Virtual machine if we create EC2 instance it has complete operating system.

## What is Docker Life cycle?
> Firstly we will write a Docker file and write set of instructions --> Build the docker file and it will create a docker image --> Push into the docker registry

## What are the different Docker Components?
> Client --> Docker CLI user can run the docker command like docker pull, docker run, docker build
> Docker Host --> Docker Demon is a heart of docker if it is goes down nothing will work in docker. It will execute the commands which are given by the user and creates images and containers.
>Registry --> we can push and pull images from the registry

## What is the difference between CMD and entrypoint in docker?
> The CMD instruction specifies default arguments or commands that can be overridden when the container is started.
```
CMD command param1 param2
```
> The ENTRYPOINT instruction defines the fixed executable that will always run when the container starts.
```
ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2
```

## What are the networking types in docker and what is the default?
> The default networking is the Bridge networking - There is a virtual ethernet or V8 that is created using which it tries to access host and application inside the container.

## Can you explain how to isolate networking between your container?
> We can use different networking types like Bridge networking, Docker zero. 
>While creating a container you can define networking in the command 
>docker create network securenetwork
>docker run --network=securenetwork

## What is a muLti stage build in docker?
> Multi stage build allows you to build the docker container in multiple stages allowing you to copy artifacts from one stage to other. Major advantage is to build the light weight applications.

```
#dockerfile
# Step 1: Build the Go binary
FROM golang:1.18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod tidy
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp .

# Step 2: Create the final image with the compiled binary
FROM gcr.io/distroless/base
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp
CMD ["/myapp"]
```

## What are distro less images in docker?
> Distro less images will contain only application and its runtime dependencies with very minimal operating system libraries. They are small and light weight images. It will help to secure from vulnarbilities.

```
docker pull gcr.io/distroless/python3

#dockerfile
FROM gcr.io/distroless/java
COPY target/myapp.jar /myapp.jar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/myapp.jar"]
```
