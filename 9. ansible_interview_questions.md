```

## When condition
```
---
- name: This playbook install package
  hosts: all ##Host selection
  become: yes ##It means execute using sudo access
  tasks:
  - name: installing package
    yum:
       name: httpd
       state: installed ##present or latest
    when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
  - name: installing package
    apt:
       name: httpd
       state: present ##present or latest
    when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
```

## Multiple users
```
---
- name: This playbook creates a user
  hosts: all ##Host selection
  become: yes ##It means execute using sudo access
  tasks:
  - name: creating a users
    user:
      name: "{{item}}"
      state: present
    with_items:
       - raj
       - hari
```
## Handlers
```
---
- name: This playbook install and start package by handlers
  hosts: all ##Host selection
  become: yes ##It means execute using sudo access
  tasks:
  - name: installing package
    yum:
       name: httpd
       state: installed ##present or latest
    notify: start service
  handlers:
  - name: start service
    service:
       name: httpd
       state: started
```

## 1. What is configuration management?
> It is process or method of managing your software or hardware. For example we have 100 of machine, it is not easy to handle by doing manually. So we use configuration management tools.

## 2. Do you think Ansible is better than other configuration tools?
> Ansible is different to other tools in the market
> For example Ansible is agentless, if we want configure 100 of machine, other configuration management tools have master and slave concept.
> Ansible can be easily installed in host by that we can configure remaining hosts.
> Ansible is used YAML to write playbook.

## 3. Can you write playbook to install httpd service and get running
```
##Installing package
---
- name: These playbook install packages
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Package installation
    yum:
      name: Package installation
      state: installed
```

## 4. How Ansible helped your organisation
> Previously using shell scripts and doing manually tasks for installtion. later by using Ansible we have automatedd those tasks.
> Package installation, basic security patching, mandatory installation

## 5. What is Ansible dynamic inventory
>Ansible dynamic inventory keeps looking at new VMs and it will configure all the new VMs with previous configurations.
> Let assume Admin is creating VMs on AWS. Ansible used to configure VMs like installation on VMs.
> Later VMs were increased where Ansible dynamic inventory will take care of new machines.

## 6. What is ansible tower [Not Mandatory to explain - we only working on Ansible CI]
> Ansible tower is enterprise model of ansible. Where it provides graphical user interface.

## 7. Can you explain me structure of ansible playbook using roles
```
project/
├── roles/
│   ├── role_name/
│   │   ├── tasks/
│   │   │   └── main.yml

```
## Playbook using roles
```
---
- name: Playbook using roles
  hosts: all
  become: true
  roles:
    - role_name1
    - role_name2
```

## 8. What are handlers in ansible and why they are used
> Handlers in Ansible are special tasks that are triggered by other tasks during a playbook's execution. 
> They are typically used to perform actions that are dependent on the state of another task, such as restarting a service after a configuration change.

## Handlers
```
---
- name: This playbook install and start package by handlers
  hosts: all ##Host selection
  become: yes ##It means execute using sudo access
  tasks:
  - name: installing package
    yum:
       name: httpd
       state: installed ##present or latest
    notify: start service
  handlers:
  - name: start service
    service:
       name: httpd
       state: started
```

## 9. I would like to run specific set of tasks in Windows and not in linux machine
> Yes, find operating system. We can use tags so we can acheive this tasks

## 10. Does Ansible supports parallel execution of tasks
> Ansible will take task one and it will run these task on all VMs parallely. Remaining tasks in serial.

## 11. What is the protocol used that ansible used to connect VMs and windows
> ssh to connect linux and winrm to connect windows.

## 12. Can you place them in order of precedence - Playbook, group_vars, role_vars and extra_vars
> role_vars, group_vars, playbook and extra_vars

## 13. How do we handle secrets in Ansible?
> Ansible supports Hashicorp valut, so we can store secrets in Hasicorp vault

## 14. Can you use ansible as IAC? If yes can you compare it with any other IAC Tool like terraform?
>Ansible is not an IAC Tool, pridominantly it is Configuration management tool.
>It will achive some tasks which terraform can do.

## 15. Write a playbook to create ec2 instance
```
Install below:
ansible-galaxy collection install community.aws
ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws

---
- name: Create an EC2 instance
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    aws_region: "us-east-1"
    instance_type: "t2.micro"
    key_name: "my-key-pair"               # Replace with your key pair name
    ami_id: "ami-0c94855ba95c71c99"      # Replace with the AMI ID for your region
    instance_name: "MyEC2Instance"
    security_group: "my-security-group"  # Replace with your security group
    subnet_id: "subnet-0abcd1234"        # Replace with your subnet ID

  tasks:
    - name: Launch EC2 instance
      community.aws.ec2_instance:
        name: "{{ instance_name }}"
        key_name: "{{ key_name }}"
        region: "{{ aws_region }}"
        instance_type: "{{ instance_type }}"
        image_id: "{{ ami_id }}"
        wait: yes
        wait_timeout: 500
        vpc_subnet_id: "{{ subnet_id }}"
        security_groups: 
          - "{{ security_group }}"
      register: ec2_info

    - name: Display EC2 instance information
      debug:
        var: ec2_info
```

## 16. Can you talk about a Ansible playbook that you have wrote and how it helped the organisation
>Used to install packages to reduce time.
>Installing kubernetes and tough task.

## 17. What do you think ansible to improve
>Increase the verbosity[Debug level] of tasks
>Ansible support for windows to be improved
>Auto suggestions ids need be improved
