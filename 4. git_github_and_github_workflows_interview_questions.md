## How to clone private git repo.

##### Using SSH
> **Step 1:** Ensure you have an SSH key
```
ls -al ~/.ssh
```
> If you don't have one, generate it:
```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
> **Step 2:** Add your public key to the Git server (e.g., GitHub)
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
> - Copy and paste it into your Git account (e.g., GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG Keys → New SSH key).
> **Step 3:** Clone the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
```

## How to create or initialize the git respository
> git init and creates .git folder

## Command to check untracked files
```
git status
```
## Command to push the code to local repo
``` 
git add
```
## The difference between git fetch, git pull, and git push lies in how they interact with the remote repository.
### git fetch (Get Latest Changes Without Merging)
>- Retrieves new changes from the remote repository but does not merge them into your local branch.
>- Allows you to check updates before applying them.
>- Useful for checking what has changed before merging.

>- This fetches the latest changes from the origin remote but doesn’t modify your working directory.
```
git fetch origin
```

### git pull (Fetch + Merge)
>- Fetches new changes from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch.
>- Equivalent to running git fetch followed by git merge.
>- Used to update your local branch with remote changes.

>- This fetches the latest changes from the main branch and merges them into your local branch.
```
git pull origin main
```

### git push (Upload Local Changes to Remote)
>- Sends your local commits to the remote repository.
>- Only works if your local branch is ahead of the remote branch (i.e., you have new commits).
>- If someone else has pushed changes that you don’t have, you may need to git pull first.
>
>- This pushes your local main branch to the remote repository.
```
git push origin main
```

## Difference between git revert and git reset
### git revert — Undo by Moving Forward
>- What it does: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit.
```
git revert <commit-hash>
```
>Use case:
>- You made a mistake in a commit that’s already been pushed to main and others are using the branch. Use revert to safely "undo" it without breaking history.

### git reset — Undo by Rewriting History
>- What it does: Moves the current branch pointer to a previous commit.
> Flavors of reset:
>- Soft (--soft): Keeps changes in staging area (index).
>- Mixed (default): Keeps changes in working directory, unstages them.
>- Hard (--hard): Deletes changes from staging and working directory.
```
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```
> Use case:
>- You committed something by mistake and want to completely erase it like it never happened — and you haven’t pushed yet.

## Do you know merge Conflict and how we can resolve it in GIT.
> A merge conflict happens when Git tries to merge two branches and:
> - The same part of a file was changed differently in both.
> - Git can’t decide which change to keep.
### How to Resolve a Merge Conflict
> - Git will mark the conflict in the file like this:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the version from your current branch (e.g., main)
=======
This is the version from the merging branch (e.g., feature)
>>>>>>> feature
```
> - Edit the file manually: Decide what to keep

### How can we avoid merge conflicts when we raise Pull request
> Avoiding merge conflicts when raising a Pull Request (PR) is mostly about keeping your feature branch up to date and following good collaboration practices.
##### 1. Keep Your Branch Up to Date
> Before raising a PR:
```
# Switch to your feature branch
git checkout feature-branch

# Update from main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main   # OR: git merge origin/main

# Push any changes
git push --force-with-lease  # if you used rebase
```
> This brings in the latest changes from main and helps you resolve any conflicts before the PR is created.

##### 2. Pull Before You Push
> When you're working in a team and others are also pushing:
```
git pull --rebase origin feature-branch
```
> Rebase keeps a clean history and reduces merge noise.

## What Is a Git Branching Strategy?
> A Git branching strategy defines how your team uses branches to manage feature development, bug fixes, releases, and deployments. It helps keep the codebase organized, stable, and easy to collaborate on.
### Why This Strategy?
>- Keeps main clean and deployable.
>- Encourages isolated, focused work.
>- Supports CI/CD pipelines and code reviews.
>- Easy to manage production releases and critical hotfixes.

## What is git stash?
> git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) your changes in a safe place, so you can:
> - Switch branches
> - Pull latest changes
> - Work on something else

## What git cherry-pick Does
> It copies a specific commit from one branch and applies it to your current branch, creating a new commit with the same changes but a new commit hash.
```
# Start on your target branch
git checkout main

# Cherry-pick the commit
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```
### When to Use It
> - You want to apply a bug fix from one branch to another without merging everything.
> - You’re on a release branch and need to backport a specific commit.
> - You want to grab just one or two commits from a long-running feature branch.

## Advantages of GitHub Actions over Jenkins
> Hosting: Jenkins is self-hosted, meaning it requires its own server to run, while GitHub Actions is hosted by GitHub and runs directly in your GitHub repository.
>
> User interface: Jenkins has a complex and sophisticated user interface, while GitHub Actions has a more streamlined and user-friendly interface that is better suited for simple to moderate automation tasks.
>
>Cost: Jenkins can be expensive to run and maintain, especially for organizations with large and complex automation needs. GitHub Actions, on the other hand, is free for open-source projects and has a tiered pricing model for private repositories, making it more accessible to smaller organizations and individual developers.

## Github action example script:
```
name: End to End CI/CD workflow for Java Applicaton with Maven, Sonar and k8s Intergation

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

env:
  KUBECONFIG: ${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }}
  SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TKN }}

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Java jdk setup
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        java-version: 12

    - name: maven target # change accordingly
      run: mvn clean install

    - name: Perform analysis on Sonar Qube
      uses: sonarsource/sonarcloud-github-action@v1
      with:
        sonarcloud.organization: <name of your org>
        sonarcloud.projectKey: <key>
        sonarcloud.projectName: <name>
        sonarcloud.token: ${{ env.SONAR_TKN }}
        sonarcloud.scannerVersion: "4.2.0.1873"

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Deploy to k8s
      uses: stefanzweifel/k8s-action@v2.0.0
      with:
        args: apply -f kubernetes/
      env:
        KUBECONFIG: ${{ env.KUBECONFIG }}
```

## I had GITHUB actions and deploy into the aws, how can I athenticate the github actions to AWS. Instead of SSH any other secure way to connect
> Best Practice: GitHub Actions → AWS with OIDC (No SSH, No Keys)
#### What is OIDC?
> OpenID Connect lets GitHub Actions assume an AWS IAM role securely — without needing to store AWS credentials in your repo or GitHub Secrets.
##### How to Set It Up (Step-by-Step)
> 1. Create an IAM Role in AWS
>- Go to the IAM console → Roles → Create role
>- Trusted Entity Type: Choose Web Identity
>- Identity Provider: GitHub
>- Use this OIDC Provider:
```
https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```
> Condition for GitHub repo access:
```
"Condition": {
  "StringLike": {
    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:<your-org>/<your-repo>:ref:refs/heads/main"
  }
}
```
>- Adjust main to your branch, or use wildcards if needed (e.g., * for all branches).
>- Give the role the policies it needs (e.g., AmazonS3FullAccess, AmazonEC2FullAccess, custom permissions, etc.)

##### 2. Note Down the Role ARN
> You’ll get something like:
```
arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-actions-deploy-role
```
##### 3. Update Your GitHub Actions Workflow
```
name: Deploy to AWS

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Configure AWS Credentials via OIDC
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
      with:
        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-actions-deploy-role
        aws-region: us-east-1

    - name: Deploy (e.g., CLI, CDK, Terraform, etc)
      run: |
        aws s3 cp ./build s3://my-deploy-bucket --recursive
```
#### Benefits of Using OIDC
>- Feature	Value
>- No long-term secrets	Safer, no key rotation needed
>- Scoped access	Only the GitHub repo you specify
>- Auditable	IAM role usage is logged in AWS
>- Easy rotation	No manual key updates needed

### Alternative (Not Recommended Unless Necessary)
>- If OIDC isn’t an option (e.g., org policy restricts it), you can:
>- Use Access Key + Secret Key in GitHub Secrets
>- Use AWS CLI to authenticate in GitHub Actions
>- But that's less secure and harder to manage than OIDC.

## Where we will store the ssh keys while using Github actions
#### Use GitHub Secrets
> You'll store your private SSH key as a secret in your repo or organization:
>- Go to your repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets.
>- Add a new secret:
>- Name: SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
>- Value: paste your private key (e.g., contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa)
