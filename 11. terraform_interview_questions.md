### Few questions on Terraform

### What is terraform
> Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources across various cloud providers and on-premise environments using a simple declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

### Example terraform file: main.yml
```
provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "instance_name" {
    ami = "ami-6544666554" #example number
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    subnet_id = "some_id_number"
}
```

### Life Cycle of terraform:
```
terraform init --> Initialize the terraform
terraform validate --> Validate the syntax
terraform plan --> Used to do the dry run before provisioning the resource
terraform apply --> Provision the resource
terraform destroy --> delete or deprovision the resource
```

### What is state file? [terraform.tfstate]
>The state file in Terraform is a critical component. It serves as a record of all resources that Terraform has created or managed, allowing it to track the current state of the infrastructure and determine the actions required to reach the desired state described in the configuration files.
```
terraform.tfstate

{
  "version": 4,
  "terraform_version": "1.10.0",
  "serial": 5,
  "lineage": "cabaefef-8b35-81f9-c735-3d356a7f4fa2",
  "outputs": {},
  "resources": [],
  "check_results": null
}
```

### If state file is deleted what we can do to retrive the data
>We have differnet solution for this:
#### Terraform statefile backup:
>Everytime If we perform any activity with terraform, it will create a back-up state file called as terraform.tfstate.backup and stored in same directory as the main state file
#### Use Remote backend:
>If you had configured a remote backend (e.g., AWS S3), the state file is stored remotely, and you can retrieve it.
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "path/to/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
  }
}
```

### If statefile is stored in another repository. How can we access that statefile?
>Import resources into Terraform:
>Use the terraform import command to associate the resource with its Terraform configuration.
>terraform import aws_instance.example i-0abc123def456gh78
>terraform import aws_instance.example i-0abcd1234efgh5678
```
import {
    id = "instance_id"

    to = "aws_instance.example"
  }
```
#### Use Remote backend:
>If you had configured a remote backend (e.g., AWS S3), the state file is stored remotely, and you can retrieve it.

#### Data source
>In Terraform, a data source allows you to query and retrieve information from external sources or resources that already exist in your infrastructure.
```
data "aws_ami" "latest_ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["099720109477"]
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }
```

### Terraform secrets
```
provider "vault" {
  address = "https://vault.example.com"
}

data "vault_kv_secret_v2" "example" {
  mount = "secret"
  name  = "myapp/db_password"
}

output "db_password" {
  value = data.vault_kv_secret_v2.example.data["password"]
  sensitive = true
}
```

### Provisioners
>These are used to execute scripts or commands on resources as part of their creation or after their creation. Provisioners are used within the Terraform configuration, and they run once when the resource is created.
```
provisioner "file" {
    source      = "app.py"  # Replace with the path to your local file
    destination = "/home/ubuntu/app.py"  # Replace with the path on the remote instance
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "echo 'Hello from the remote instance'",
      "sudo apt update -y",  # Update package lists (for ubuntu)
      "sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip",  # Example package installation
      "cd /home/ubuntu",
      "sudo pip3 install flask",
      "sudo python3 app.py &",
    ]
  }
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Terraform migration ( using import and then running terraform import command which will create a state file).
>- This will import the EC2 instance all details which was created manually.
>- Importing EC2 instance to create a state file.
 
### Terraform drift detection ( if some one manually changed any settings for any resource, then detecting that change is called drift detection).
> There are 2 ways to detect it.
>Scenario 1: Use terraform refresh using a cron job. ( terraform refresh, refershes the recents changes which was done manually to the statefile and keeps it updated.
>Scenario 2: 
>- A) Use audit/activity logs to see who made changes, if its changed by user and resources is managed by TF, then send an alert using lambda/azure functions and notify.
>- B) Apply strict IAM rules so that no one can login to console.
