### What is the difference between IAC and Configuration Managment and What kind of tools used to acheive IAC and CM
#### Configuration Management (CM)
> - CM is about maintaining system state—installing packages, configuring services, managing users, etc. It works after infrastructure exists.
> - Think of it as the step after the servers are created: now we configure them.
> CM handles:
> - Installing NGINX, MySQL, Docker, etc.
> - Managing config files
> - Applying security patches
> - Ensuring desired state is maintained
> - Ex: Ansible, Chef, puppet
#### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
> - IaC is about provisioning and managing infrastructure (servers, networks, storage, etc.) using code—instead of doing it manually via GUIs or command line.
> - It's declarative or imperative code that defines your environment.
> IaC handles:
> - Creating virtual machines
> - Setting up networks
> - Allocating storage
> - Managing cloud resources
> - Ex: Terraform, AWS Cloudformation
##### In real projects, they’re often used together:
> - Terraform provisions the servers.
> - Ansible logs into them and configures everything.

### What is terraform
> Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources across various cloud providers and on-premise environments using a simple declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

### Life Cycle of terraform:
```
terraform init --> Initialize the terraform
terraform validate --> Validate the syntax
terraform plan --> Used to do the dry run before provisioning the resource
terraform apply --> Provision the resource
terraform destroy --> delete or deprovision the resource
```

### Terraform Architecture
```
Your Local Machine (Terraform CLI)
        |
        v
Terraform Core
        |
        v
Calls Providers (AWS, Azure, etc.)
        |
        v
Applies Resources in the Cloud
        |
        v
Writes State to Backend (S3, etc.)
```

### To create ec2 instance:main.tf with specifications
```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Create a security group
resource "aws_security_group" "ssh_access" {
  name        = "allow_ssh"
  description = "Allow SSH inbound traffic"

  ingress {
    description = "SSH"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    description = "Allow all outbound traffic"
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Define key pair (assumes you have a key)
resource "aws_key_pair" "deployer" {
  key_name   = "my-key" # Replace with your key name
  public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
}

# Create an EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  ami                    = "ami-0c02fb55956c7d316" # Amazon Linux 2 AMI (update as needed)
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  key_name               = aws_key_pair.deployer.key_name
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.ssh_access.id]

  # Optional: Attach EBS volume
  root_block_device {
    volume_size = 20
    volume_type = "gp2"
    delete_on_termination = true
  }

  # User data to install Apache
  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              yum update -y
              yum install -y httpd
              systemctl start httpd
              systemctl enable httpd
              echo "Hello from Terraform!" > /var/www/html/index.html
              EOF

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform-EC2-Instance"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}
```

### What is state file? [terraform.tfstate] or ### Have you worked on backend terraform script and statefile?
> The state file in Terraform is a critical component. It serves as a record of all resources that Terraform has created or managed, allowing it to track the current state of the infrastructure and determine the actions required to reach the desired state described in the configuration files.
```
terraform.tfstate

{
  "version": 4,
  "terraform_version": "1.10.0",
  "serial": 5,
  "lineage": "cabaefef-8b35-81f9-c735-3d356a7f4fa2",
  "outputs": {},
  "resources": [],
  "check_results": null
}
```

### If state file is deleted what we can do to retrive the data
> We have differnet solution for this:
> - **Terraform statefile backup:** Everytime If we perform any activity with terraform, it will create a back-up state file called as terraform.tfstate.backup and stored in same directory as the main state file
> - **Use Remote backend:** If you had configured a remote backend (e.g., AWS S3), the state file is stored remotely, and you can retrieve it.
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "path/to/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
  }
}
```

### If statefile is stored in another repository. How can we access that statefile?
> Import resources into Terraform:
> - **Use the terraform import command** to associate the resource with its Terraform configuration.
> CLI:
```
terraform import aws_instance.example i-0abc123def456gh78
```
```
import {
    id = "instance_id"

    to = "aws_instance.example"
  }
```
> - **Use Remote backend:** If you had configured a remote backend (e.g., AWS S3), the state file is stored remotely, and you can retrieve it.
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "path/to/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
  }
}
```
> - **Data source:** In Terraform, a data source allows you to query and retrieve information from external sources or resources that already exist in your infrastructure.
```
data "aws_ami" "latest_ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["099720109477"]
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }
```

### Terraform secrets
```
provider "vault" {
  address = "https://vault.example.com"
}

data "vault_kv_secret_v2" "example" {
  mount = "secret"
  name  = "myapp/db_password"
}

output "db_password" {
  value = data.vault_kv_secret_v2.example.data["password"]
  sensitive = true
}
```

### Provisioners
> These are used to execute scripts or commands on resources as part of their creation or after their creation. Provisioners are used within the Terraform configuration, and they run once when the resource is created.
```
provisioner "file" {
    source      = "app.py"  # Replace with the path to your local file
    destination = "/home/ubuntu/app.py"  # Replace with the path on the remote instance
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "echo 'Hello from the remote instance'",
      "sudo apt update -y",  # Update package lists (for ubuntu)
      "sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip",  # Example package installation
      "cd /home/ubuntu",
      "sudo pip3 install flask",
      "sudo python3 app.py &",
    ]
  }
```

### How can we divide tier1 and tier2 of application in terraform?
> Quick Recap of Application Tiers:
> - Tier 1 (Frontend/Web tier): Web servers, load balancers, CDN, etc.
> - Tier 2 (Backend/Data tier): Application servers, databases, internal services.
> How to Divide Tier1 and Tier2 in Terraform
> - Use Modules to Separate Tiers
> - Break your infrastructure into independent modules for each tier.
> Directory structure
```
terraform/
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── tier1_frontend/
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── variables.tf
│   └── outputs.tf
└── tier2_backend/
    ├── main.tf
    ├── variables.tf
    └── outputs.tf
```
> main.tf
```
module "frontend" {
  source = "./tier1_frontend"
  instance_count = 2
  # other variables
}

module "backend" {
  source = "./tier2_backend"
  db_name = "appdb"
  vpc_id = module.frontend.vpc_id  # example dependency
}
```
#### Why Divide Tiers in Terraform?
> - Separation of concerns (network vs DB vs app)
> - Reusability (you can plug the same frontend module into dev/stage/prod)
> - Parallel development by teams
> - Better state management and scaling

### Terraform migration ( using import and then running terraform import command which will create a state file).
>- This will import the EC2 instance all details which was created manually.
>- Importing EC2 instance to create a state file.
 
### Terraform drift detection ( if some one manually changed any settings for any resource, then detecting that change is called drift detection).
> There are 2 ways to detect it.
> **Scenario 1:** 
> - Use terraform refresh using a cron job. ( terraform refresh, refershes the recents changes which was done manually to the statefile and keeps it updated.
> **Scenario 2:** 
>- A) Use audit/activity logs to see who made changes, if its changed by user and resources is managed by TF, then send an alert using lambda/azure functions and notify.
>- B) Apply strict IAM rules so that no one can login to console.
